Business Context:

The Fresh Fruit Market is a small retail business in Rwanda, operating in Kigali, Muhanga, and Huye. Sales take place from local stalls and shops. Eventhough the business runs, the sales and operations department struggles with knowing which fruits perform best in each region and season. Sometimes, inventory goes to waste or doesn’t meet demand due to that, and the business also fails to serve it's valuable customers effectively.

Data Challenge:

- Which fruits perform best in each region and season?

- Who are the top customers, and how can they be segmented?

- What trends have effect on sales and inventory?

- How can this information be used to ensure better marketing?

Expected Outcome:

- Identify the top 5 products in each region.

- Track running sales totals and growth patterns.

- Segment customers into value based groups.

- Smoothen seasonal fluctuations with moving averages.

- Plan inventory and marketing with real-time data.

Success Criteria:

1.Top 5 products per region -> RANK():
Identify highest selling fruit in each region for each quarter to optmise inventory allocation.

2. Running monthly sales total -> SUM() Over():
   Track cumulative sales performance through out the month to monitor cashflow and seasonal trends.

3. Month-Over-Month growth -> LAG(), LEAD():
   Calculate percentage change in monthly sales compared to previous month to identify growth with patterns and declining performance.
   
4. Customer quartiles -> NTILE(4): segment customer into 4 value-based groups (high, medium-high, medium-low, low spenders) for targeted marketing strategies.

5. 3-month moving averages -> AVG(), OVER():
   Calculating rolling 3-month average sales by region to smoothen Seasonal fluctuation and identify underlying trends for inventory planning.

Relationships: 
Customers - Transactions 1:M -> 1 customer can make many transactions.
Products - Transactions M:1  -> 1 product can be used in many transactions.                         

Functions' queries:
1. Ranking functions:
   SELECT
    region,
    product_name,
    total_sales,
    total_quantity,
    row_number_rank,
    sales_rank,
    dense_sales_rank,
    percent_rank
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.region,
        p.name as product_name,
        SUM(t.total_amount) as total_sales,
        SUM(t.quantity) as total_quantity,
        -- ROW_NUMBER: Sequential ranking with no ties.
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(t.total_amount) DESC) as row_number_rank,
         -- RANK: Ranking with gaps for ties if two products have same sales, they get same rank then skips next rank.
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(t.total_amount) DESC) as sales_rank,
        -- DENSE_RANK: Ranking with no gaps for ties if two products have same sales, they get same rank, next rank continues sequently wit no skipping
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(t.total_amount) DESC) as dense_sales_rank,
        -- PERCENT_RANK: Percentage relative standing 0 = lowest sales, 1 = highest sales in a region.
        PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(t.total_amount) DESC) as percent_rank 
    FROM transactions t
    JOIN products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE t.sale_date >= DATE '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY c.region, p.name
)
WHERE sales_rank <= 5
ORDER BY region, sales_rank;
-- INTERPRETATION:
--This query shows which fruits sell best in each region. For example, if avocados in Kigali keep being ranked at the top, it means the business should have there more avocados. RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER() just give a bit different perspectives on how products compare.

2. Aggregate Functions:
SELECT
    sale_year,
    sale_month,
    monthly_sales,
    -- RUNNING TOTAL: Tracks performance and overall growth path for each year
    SUM(monthly_sales) OVER (
        PARTITION BY sale_year ORDER BY sale_month ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as running_total,
    --3-MONTH MOVING AVERAGE: Provides trend direction
    AVG(monthly_sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY sale_year, sale_month ROWS 2 PRECEDING
    ) as moving_avg_3month,
    -- 3-MONTH MAXIMUM: Shows the highest sales in the recent 3 months
    MAX(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_year, sale_month ROWS 2 PRECEDING) as max_3month,
    -- 3-MONTH MINIMUM: Shows the lowest sales in the recent 3 months
    MIN(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_year, sale_month ROWS 2 PRECEDING) as min_3month
FROM (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as sale_year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as sale_month,
        SUM(total_amount) as monthly_sales
    FROM transactions
    WHERE sale_date >= DATE '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date))
ORDER BY sale_year, sale_month;
--INTERPRETATION:
--The running totals show how sales accumulate in the year, which is useful for checking overall growth. The moving averages help smoothen seasonal ups and downs. For example, if sales fall in June but rise again in July, the 3-month moving average shows the general trend not just the fall. This makes it easier to plan ahead.

3. Navigation functions:
SELECT
 region,
 sale_month,
 monthly_sales,
 -- LAG: Access the data of the sales of the previous month for comparing
 LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (
 PARTITION BY region
 ORDER BY sale_month
 ) as prev_month_sales,
 -- LEAD: Access the data of the sales of the next month for forecasting
 LEAD(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (
 PARTITION BY region
 ORDER BY sale_month
 ) as next_month_sales,
 ROUND(
 ((monthly_sales - LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (
 PARTITION BY region
 ORDER BY sale_month
 )) * 100.0) /
 NULLIF(LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (
 PARTITION BY region
 ORDER BY sale_month
 ), 0), 2
 ) as mom_growth_percent,
 CASE
 WHEN monthly_sales > LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (
 PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_month
 ) THEN 'Growing'
 WHEN monthly_sales < LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (
 PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_month
 ) THEN 'Declining'
 ELSE 'Stable'
 END as growth_trend
FROM (
 SELECT
 c.region,
 EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as sale_month,
 SUM(t.total_amount) as monthly_sales
 FROM transactions t
 JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
 WHERE t.sale_date >= DATE '2024-01-01'
 GROUP BY c.region, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date)
) region_monthly_sales
ORDER BY region, sale_month;
-- Interpretation:
-- LAG() and LEAD() are used for comparing sales month to month. The percentage growth column shows whether a region is growing or declining. For example, if Muhanga shows 8% growth for three months that follow each other, that is a sign the market is expanding there.

4. Distribution functions:
SELECT
 name as customer_name,
 region,
 total_spent,
 transaction_count,
 avg_transaction_value,
 -- NTILE(4): Divide customers into 4 equal groups basing on the total spending
 NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) as customer_quartile,
 -- CUME_DIST(): Calculate percentage of cumulative distribution 
 ROUND(CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) * 100, 2) as cumulative_percentile,
 CASE 
 WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 1 THEN 'VIP Customers (Top 25%)'
 WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 2 THEN 'High Value (26-50%)'
 WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 3 THEN 'Medium Value (51-75%)'
 ELSE 'Basic Customers (Bottom 25%)'
 END as customer_segment,
 CASE
 WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 1 THEN 'Premium offers, exclusive events'
 WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 2 THEN 'Loyalty rewards, bulk discounts'
 WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 3 THEN 'Regular promotions, seasonal offers'
 ELSE 'Basic promotions, retention campaigns'
 END as marketing_strategy
FROM (
 SELECT
 c.name,
 c.region,
 SUM(t.total_amount) as total_spent,
 COUNT(t.transaction_id) as transaction_count,
 ROUND(AVG(t.total_amount), 2) as avg_transaction_value
 FROM customers c
 JOIN transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
 WHERE t.sale_date >= DATE '2024-01-01'
 GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.region
 HAVING COUNT(t.transaction_id) >= 2 
) customer_summary
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
--INTERPRETATION:
-- The query groups customers into four quartiles. The top 25% are the VIP customers(cleients) and bring in the majority of revenue to the business, as for the bottom 25% are casual buyers. Linking each quartile with a marketing strategy helps the business to personalize its approach. For example, VIP customers might get exclusive offers, while casual customers might be attracted with promotions to encourage more purchases.
